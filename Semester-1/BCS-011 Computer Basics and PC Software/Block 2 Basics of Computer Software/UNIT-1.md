## WHAT IS SOFTWARE ?
Computer software is a set of simple and step-by-step sequence of instructions that tell the hardware what to do and how to do it.

## TYPES OF SOFTWARE
There is a wide variety of software available today. And there is no clear cut distinction in certain software systems. Still, most computer software can be broadly classified as:
- System software
- Programming software
- Application software

### System Software
System software helps run the computer hardware and system. It is designed to control the operations of a computer and coordinate all external devices like communication devices, printers, keyboards, display units, etc. It manages all the computer resources like memory and processor time in optimal and stable manner.

Some common types of system software are:
- Operating Systems
- Server Programs
- Device Drivers
- Communications Software

### Programming Software
Programming software usually provides tools to assist a programmer in writing computer programs, and software using different programming languages in a more convenient way.

Programming Software includes the following:
- Compilers
- Debuggers
- Interpreters
- Linkers
- Text Editors

### Application Software
Application software is designed and developed to accomplish one or more specific task or solve a particular problem.

Some major categories of these applications include:
- Word Processing Software
- Spreadsheet Software
- Database Software
- Presentation Software
- Graphic Software
- Multimedia Authoring Application

## UTILITY SOFTWARE
Utility programs help manage, maintain and control computer resources. These programs are available to help you with the day-to-day chores associated with personal computing and to keep your system running at peak performance.

Examples:
- Anti-various software 
- Backup Utilities
- Diagnostic programs
- File view programs
- Computer performance enhancement utilities


## PERVERSE SOFTWARE
Perverse software is a program which causes hindrances in other programs execution in such a way resulting in modification or complete destruction of data without the user's intention or even sabotaging the operational system.

Perverse Software is also known as Malicious software or malware

Typical types of malicious software are - Computer virus, Computer Worm, Trojan horse, Rootkits, Spyware etc


## OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
Open Source Software (OSS) is software that comes with source code, and importantly also provides rights (typically reserved for copyright holders) to study, change and improve the software. This development happens in a larger collaborative environment, without any direct objective of the softwareâ€˜s
commercial success.
